Really? They still test with pencil and paper?

<h3>Help students. Learn Ruby/RAILS</h3>
Are you the right person to change education? To help move schools to the 21st century? To bring on individualized education?

The K-12 big-T Tests suck, not least because of all the things they don't test which too often get left behind. Maybe you or someone you know can help change this.

The goal is a highly functional learning and assessment framework. One that can run on all computers (not just those with Flash).

At the moment, the repository contains just a seed: basically an app I wrote to master a little bit of world history.

Your mission is to add to it, to make it more of a generalized learning and assessment tool. One example of such a tool is [Quedoc](http://www.qedoc.com/products.php?p=author)



<h3>Learning Spec'ing by Spec'ing Learning</h3>

You might start by just adding some test specs. Or, try adding some code. (Or help me make the project more developer-friendly). 

We're all familiar with the domain: initially those little quizzes and worksheets we all did--but online, interactive, and with a tad more feeling. For lack of a better term (maybe you know of better research), I call them <i>Interactive Learning Patterns</i>. .

What are some Interactive Learning Patterns?
<ul>
<li>Good old Multiple Choice</li>
<li>Matching words or phrases</li>
<li>Matching pictures</li>
<li>Sorting</li>
<li>True/False</li>
<li>Ranking</li>
<li>Fill-in-the-blank</li>
</ul>


<h3>No Flash?</h3>
"Wouldn't Flash/ActionScript be a jazzier way to do this?", our non-RAILS frinds might ask? Yes. Until you ramp it up and it gets expensive fast when you want to add coaching and gaming pieces. Still, good thinking, later we'll talk of <a href="http://projectsprouts.org/">Project Sprouts</a>.
Also, IOS doesn't support Flash, so our iPad friends are screwed.
