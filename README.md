<h2>EduGem</h2>
<h4>Really? They still test with pencil and paper?</h4>

EduGem doesn't suffer from small goals--but we'll get to that later. Small steps first.

<h3>A BDD/TDD playpen</h3>
For now, this is an exercise for a group of us learning to do <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/achbd/the-rspec-book">BDD</a>--Behavior- (or Test-) Driven Development. 

I'm seeding it with a few simple Features. I hope some of you will take it deep or wide as you see fit.

<h3>Learning Spec'ing by Spec'ing Learning</h3>

We're all familiar with the domain: initially those little quizzes and worksheets we all did--but online, interactive, and with a tad more feeling. For lack of a better term (maybe you know of better research), I call them <i>Interactive Learning Patterns</i>. .

What are some Interactive Learning Patterns?
<ul>
<li>Good old Multiple Choice</li>
<li>Matching words or phrases</li>
<li>Matching pictures</li>
<li>Sorting</li>
<li>True/False</li>
<li>Ranking</li>
<li>Fill-in-the-blank</li>
</ul>

"Wouldn't Flash/ActionScript be a jazzier way to do this?", our non-RAILS frinds might ask? Yes. Until you ramp it up and it gets expensive fast when you want to add coaching and gaming pieces. Still, good thinking, later we'll talk of <a href="http://projectsprouts.org/">Project Sprouts</a>.

OK, Ed, write specs.
