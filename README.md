<h2>EduGem</h2>
<h4>Really? They still test with pencil and paper?</h4>

EduGem doesn't suffer from small goals--but we'll get to that later. Small steps first.

For now, this is an exercise for a group of us learning to do <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/achbd/the-rspec-book">BDD</a>--Behavior- (or Test-) Driven Development. 

I'm seeding it with a few simple Features. I hope some of you will take it deep or wide as you see fit.

We're all familiar with the domain: initially those little quizzes and worksheets we all did, but online, interactive, and with a tad more feeling. For lack of a better term, I call them <i>Interactive Learning Patterns</i>. Maybe you know of better research.

What are some Interactive Learning Patterns?
- Good old Multiple Choice
- Matching words or phrases
- Matching pictures
- Sorting
- True/False
- Ranking
- Fill-in-the-blank

"Wouldn't Flash/ActionScript be a jazzier way to do this?", our non-RAILS frinds might ask? Yes...yet that gets expensive fast when you want to add coaching and gaming pieces. Still, good thinking, later we'll talk of <a href="http://projectsprouts.org/">Project Sprouts</a>.

OK, write specs, Ed.
